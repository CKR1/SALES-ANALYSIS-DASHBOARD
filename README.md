SALES ANALYSIS | DASHBOARD

Problem Statement: -
The Food and Beverage store is experiencing a decline in sales, and the management team needs to 
identify the underlying causes to address them effectively. The company sells food and beverages 
through three channels: distribution, online, and retail. Despite having a diverse range of products, the 
company is facing challenges in identifying the most profitable items and channels. The management 
team wants to analyze the sales data to identify the key drivers of sales and understand customer 
preferences to improve sales performance. The goal is to increase revenue and market share while 
reducing costs and optimizing sales strategy. The problem statement, therefore, is to analyze the sales 
data to identify the underlying factors affecting sales performance across the three sales channels and 
develop strategies to improve sales performance.

Business Objective:

• The objective of the Food and Beverage store is to increase revenue and market share by 
optimizing its sales strategy across its three sales channels - distribution, online, and retail. 
• The company aims to achieve this objective by identifying the key drivers of sales, 
understanding customer preferences, and improving sales performance.
• The company also seeks to track revenue generated by salespersons and orders fulfilled by 
salespersons to identify top-performing salespeople and allocate resources effectively.


Pain Areas:

• There are several pain areas related to the sales analysis of the Food and Beverage store:
• Declining Sales: The company is experiencing a decline in sales, which is a significant pain 
point for the business. This decline in sales could be due to various factors, such as changes in 
customer preferences or increased competition.
• Lack of Sales Visibility: The company may not have a clear understanding of its sales 
performance across its three sales channels, making it difficult to identify the most profitable 
products and channels. This lack of visibility can lead to ineffective sales strategies and lost 
revenue opportunities.
• Poor Inventory Management: The company may be struggling with inventory management, 
resulting in stockouts or overstocking of certain products, which can lead to lost sales or 
increased carrying costs.
• Ineffective Sales Strategies: The company may be using ineffective sales strategies that do not 
resonate with its customers, resulting in decreased sales performance.
• Inadequate Customer Insights: The company may not have adequate customer insights to 
understand their preferences, purchase behavior, and feedback. This lack of customer insights 
can lead to missed opportunities for improving sales performance and customer satisfaction.
• Inefficient Sales Team Performance: The company may be struggling with inefficient sales 
team performance, resulting in decreased revenue and missed sales opportunities. It may not 
have a clear understanding of which salespeople are performing well and which ones are not.
• Poor Resource Allocation: The company may be allocating resources inefficiently, resulting in 
missed revenue opportunities. Without tracking revenue and order by 
salesperson, the company may not have the necessary insights to allocate resources effectively.
• Lack of Accountability: Without tracking revenue and orders by salesperson, the company may 
lack accountability in its sales team. Identifying which salespeople are
meeting their targets and which ones are falling behind may be challenging.
• Ineffective Sales Training: The company may be providing ineffective sales training, leading 
to some salespeople underperforming. Without tracking revenue and orders by salesperson, 
the company may not have the necessary insights to identify which salespeople require 
additional training.
• Missed Cross-Selling Opportunities: Without tracking revenue and orders by salesperson, the 
company may be missing cross-selling opportunities. Salespeople may not be trained to 
identify opportunities to upsell or cross-sell, resulting in missed revenue opportunities.


CONTRIBUTORS 

Analyzing the top three contributors to solving the sales analysis problem for the Food and 
The beverage store would involve identifying the most critical factors that impact sales 
performance across the three sales channels. Based on the problem statement and pain areas 
identified earlier, the top three contributors are:
• Sales Channel Analysis: Analyzing sales data for each sales channel can help identify which 
channels are most profitable and which ones require improvement. This analysis can also 
identify which products are selling well in each channel and which ones are not, allowing the 
company to optimize its product mix. By identifying the most profitable channels, the company 
can focus its resources and sales efforts on those channels, leading to increased revenue and 
market share.
• Product Analysis: Another contributor to solving the sales analysis problem for the Food and 
The beverage store is product analysis. Analyzing product performance data can help the company 
identify which products are most profitable and which ones require improvement. This analysis 
can also identify which products are popular with customers and which ones are not, allowing 
the company to optimize its product mix. By identifying top-performing products, the company 
can allocate resources and sales efforts effectively to increase revenue and market share.
Product analysis can also identify potential opportunities for product innovation or 
development. By analyzing customer feedback and preferences, the company can identify gaps 
in its product mix and develop new products that meet customer needs. This approach can lead 
to increased sales performance and customer satisfaction.
• Salesperson Performance Analysis: Tracking revenue by salesperson and order by 
salesperson can help the company identify its top-performing salespeople and allocate 
resources effectively. This analysis can also identify salespeople who require additional 
training or support, leading to improved sales performance. By tracking salesperson 
performance, the company can create a culture of accountability, leading to increased sales 
performance and revenue generation.
For e.g.., In my problem, I have tried to analyze the following things –
• How categories like drinks and food are being distributed and sold through the different 
distribution channels like Distributors, Online, and retail. 
• What is the total amount of revenue they can generate, what is the total amount of orders? 
• How much revenue and orders per month. 
• What is the revenue by channel, product category, and product group? 
• What is the Revenue by Salesperson?
• What are the Orders by Salesperson?
• How many orders by the product category? 
• How they are performing in different quarters.

Over here we have tried to analyze the different categories of food and beverages offered 
by the store and how it is being sold by salespersons through different distribution channels and 
how are they performing in different quarters? 


In conclusion, analyzing sales channel, product, and salesperson performance data are the top 
three contributors to solving the sales analysis problem for the Food and Beverage store. By 
focusing on these areas, the company can optimize its sales strategy, improve revenue 
generation, and increase market share.

RECOMMENDATION FOR SOLVING THE CHALLENGES


To address the challenges related to sales analysis for the Food and Beverage store, leadership 
can consider the following recommendations:
• Increase promotion and sales of Tomato Sauce and Tea: Since Tomato Sauce and Tea are the 
lowest-selling products in their respective categories, the company should focus on increasing 
promotion and sales of these products. This can be achieved through targeted advertising and 
promotions, discounts, and bundling deals.
• Review the pricing strategy for Wheat Flour and Liquor: As Wheat Flour and Liquor are the 
highest-selling products in their respective categories, the company should review their pricing 
strategy to ensure they are being sold at a competitive price point. This will help maintain and 
potentially increase sales of these products.
• Focus on maximizing revenue in Quarter 2: As the lowest revenue is generated in Quarter 2 for 
both the Food and Drinks categories, the company should focus on developing targeted sales and 
marketing strategies to maximize revenue during this quarter. This could include introducing 
new products, promotions, or events to encourage sales during this period.
• Enhance the online distribution channel: Since the retail distribution channel has generated the 
highest revenue compared to online and through distributors, the company should focus on 
enhancing their online distribution channel. This can be achieved by improving the user 
experience with the company's e-commerce website, offering competitive pricing and 
promotions, and providing efficient delivery and logistics services.
• Diversify product offerings: To further increase revenue and market share, the company should 
consider diversifying its product offerings. This could include introducing new products or 
variations of existing products, as well as expanding into new categories and markets.
• Conduct market research and customer feedback analysis: To ensure the company's sales 
strategies and product offerings align with customer needs and preferences, it is essential to 
conduct regular market research and customer feedback analysis. This will provide valuable 
insights into trends and demand, and allow the company to make informed decisions about its 
sales strategy and product offerings.
• Conduct Data Analysis: The company should conduct a thorough data analysis of its sales data 
to identify patterns and trends. This analysis can provide insights into which products are 
selling well, which sales channels are most profitable, and which customers are the most 
valuable.
• Forecast Sales Performance: The company should use the available data to forecast its sales 
performance for the future. This can help the company plan its resources and sales strategies 
more effectively.
• Use Predictive Analytics: The company should leverage predictive analytics to identify which 
products are likely to sell well in the future and which customers are most likely to make a 
purchase. This analysis can help the company tailor its sales and marketing efforts to increase 
revenue generation.
• Implement Business Intelligence Tools: The company should implement business intelligence 
tools to provide real-time insights into sales performance and customer behavior. This can help 
the company identify areas for improvement and optimize its sales strategy.
• Regular Reporting: The company should regularly report on sales performance to ensure that 
the leadership team is aware of the latest trends and developments. This can help the company 
make informed decisions and take corrective action where necessary.
• In summary, the company can increase sales revenue and market share by focusing on 
promoting and selling low-performing products, reviewing pricing strategies for high-performing products, maximizing revenue in low-performing quarters, enhancing the online 
distribution channel, diversifying product offerings and conducting regular market research 
and customer feedback analysis.
By implementing these recommendations, the company can better understand the problems 
and pain areas related to sales analysis and take corrective action to improve revenue generation 
and market share. Proper data analysis and forecasting of available data can provide the 
company with valuable insights and help it optimize its sales strategy.
In conclusion, the Food and Beverage store can address the challenges related to sales analysis 
by implementing a sales performance management system, conducting sales channels and 
product analysis, developing a sales training program, establishing accountability measures, 
implementing customer feedback mechanisms, and fostering a culture of continuous 
improvement. By adopting these recommendations, the company can optimize its sales 
strategy, improve revenue generation and increase market share.
